# React Maps - frontend
#### Made as a recruitment task
## Setup guide
1. Clone repository
2. Run "npm install"
3. Edit /src/config.json with your backend url (optional)
## Additional info
Decided to use Vite instead of Webpack (here why: https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html). Also refreshing website hosted on vercel causes 404 error. It's not the case on localhost or other hosts. I'm sure it's vercel only issue.
